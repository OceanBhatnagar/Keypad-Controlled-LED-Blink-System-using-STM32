# Keypad-Controlled LED Blink System Using STM32  

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a **Keypad-Controlled LED Blink System** using an STM32 microcontroller.
The system allows users to control the blinking of LEDs based on the input from a 4x4 matrix keypad. 
This project demonstrates bare-metal programming and GPIO configuration using the STM32 Nucleo board.  

## Features  
- **Keypad Input**: 4x4 matrix keypad for user input.  
- **LED Control**: Up to 5 LEDs are controlled based on the keypad input.  
- **Bare-Metal Programming**: Implemented without using HAL libraries, focusing on direct register manipulation.  
- **STM32 GPIO and Pull-up Resistors**: Configured for stable and reliable keypad operation.  

## Components Used  
- **STM32 Nucleo Board** (STM32F410RB).  
- **4x4 Matrix Keypad**.  
- **5 LEDs** (connected to GPIO pins).   
- **Breadboard** and **Jumper Wires**.  

## Tools Used  
- **STM32CubeIDE**: For writing, compiling, and uploading the code.  

## Project Structure  
- **Source Code**: C code for keypad scanning, LED control, and system logic.  
- **Project Photographs**: Images showing the setup and working of the system.
